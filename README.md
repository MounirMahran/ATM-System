# ATM-System  
An ATM system that allows users to withdraw money, deposit money, check their account balance, and more. This system is designed to work with the same database used by the bank system in the last two repositories, using the same ReadInputs library and Clients.txt file.

The system is implemented using functional programming and is divided into smaller functions to make it easier to maintain and update.

**Deposit:** Allows users to deposit money into their account.
