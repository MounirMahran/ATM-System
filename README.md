# ATM-System
In addition to the bank system in the last two repos, I created an ATM system to handle users transactions
The system uses the same ReadInputs library and Clients.txt file, so it's somehow attached to the same database :-).

I used functional programming and divided the system into smaller functions, so I could focus on one thing at a time
